This is a weird project where I try and make and incredibly limited Game Engine based on DirectX 11 (Direct3D, Direct2D, and DirectWrite)

This currently has
[ ] Helpers
  [x] Stable Random Generation (Not sure why you'd want to use this, but it's there :p)
  [ ] More Helpers

[x] An Update Loop 
  [x] Fixed Loop
  [x] Non-fixed Loop

[ ] Direct2D
  [x] Brushes
  [x] Text Formats
    - Note, The Default Font is "Fira Code"
  [ ] Text
  [x] Geometry Call
  [ ] Sprites
    [ ] Loading Sprites
    [ ] Drawing Sprites
  
[ ] Direct3D
  - Unsure what to put here :think:
  - I'm not very good at 3D Stuff, tbh
  - Ideas pls :p

[ ] Physics
  [ ] 2D Physics
  [ ] 3D Physics

[ ] Collision
  [ ] 2D
  [ ] 3D

[ ] Audio
[ ] Think of more stuff to write

### NOTE
A lot of this functionality I want to add is technically already in DX11. 
What I want to do is make it much simpler to use In-Engine.
